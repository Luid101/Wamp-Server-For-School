Extract the contents of the "www" folder into your localhost folder on your server. 
Then go to the folder "db_file" and extract the database "login_register" into your server's built sql database. 
If you did all that well then you should be golden. 

However if your not Golden then you might need to change the username and password in the PHP code that the program uses to access the database.
To do that go to the folder that contains the files you copied from the "www" folder. 
Open up the file called "db.php".
On line 6 you can change "$mysql_username = "root";" to what ever your database username is.
On line 7 you can change "$mysql_password = "";" to what ever your database password is.
And then you should be GOLDEN!

The database should be pretty easy to use once you have everything setup. However I might be posting a tutorial on it later on.
